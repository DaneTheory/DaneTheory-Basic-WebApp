I’m building my portfolio using NodeJS. Meteor seemed the logical route for a basic website. 
This is a stupid simple bare bones meter stack. 

What’s Done:
-Clean File Structure
-Meny.js provides the default styling and functionality of the the sites main navigation
-Basic routing is setup and ready to go (via iron:routes)
-OCD Favicon and meta data setup for mimicking

I’ll end up using this template again so I’ll keep it a work in progress for best standards and providing the most functionality 
with as little overhead as possible. I want this to stay a relative skeleton for Meteor webapps.

That being said, you’ll need to edit the meta data and favicon data.


Instructions:
1.) Download a zip of this file. 
2.) Move the zip to wherever it may be you like keeping dev projects.
3.) Unzip. 
4.) Using Terminal, cd into the folder. 
5.) Type the command “meteor” and you are good to go.

TODO:
-After I finish the full WebApp, I'll go through and strip out all the unneccessary parts. Factor it into being a
solid skeletion for rapid development as well as helping novice users wanting to start developing in NodeJS.
-Comment the hell out of everything for relatively new users to learn.
